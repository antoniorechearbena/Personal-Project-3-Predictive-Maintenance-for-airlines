# Predictive Maintenance for Airlines 
This project will help airlines know with more accuracy when is necessary for airplanes to head to maintenance. This will help airlines plan and organize with more efficiency when planes need to head for maintenance.

This project uses NASAâ€™s C-MAPSS dataset to analyze and predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines.  
Steps:
1. Data loading & exploration  
2. Feature engineering  
3. Baseline ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
4. Results & evaluation  

## Project structure
- `data/` : datasets
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- `src/` : reusable Python scripts
- `results/` : plots, metrics, saved models
